# CS-A0
Assignment A0 for Computer Systems.

This assignment contains a program, file.c, that can recognise and differ between the following file types:

- empty files
- ASCII text files
- ISO-8859 text files
- UTF-8 Unicode text files

The program will detect all other files as data files. Unless they are inaccessable; then they will be detected as such.

Assignment A0 also contains a testing script, bash.sh. This script creates files of the various types; and checks if file.c recognizes them correctly.
This script can be run in the terminal with the `test test.sh` command while in src/ directory.
